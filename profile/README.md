  ### Hi there 👋

  <p>
    THINK ZAMBIA is a Zambian-owned organization founded in 2017 that provides opportunities for communities to learn and grow in Technology. We believe digital literacy is a human right, so we provide facillities and implement computer literacy programs for children and youth. Our goal is to demystify computer science and provide an open platform for Zambia's talent to showcase and advance their ideas, find jobs and contribute to Zambia's overall digital landscape. In addition, we are actively involved in protecting the planet by aiding the integration into a paperless work environment via our suite of Software Solutions.
